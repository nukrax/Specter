 **WARNING!!! JAMMING IS ILLEGAL**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is developed for **educational and research purposes only**. The RF disruption feature (JR.IO) transmits a constant 2.4 GHz carrier wave and may interfere with WiFi, Bluetooth, and other 2.4 GHz communications in the vicinity. Usage of such functionality may be **regulated or illegal in your jurisdiction**. The developer assumes no responsibility for misuse. Always operate within the bounds of your local laws and regulations.

## Overview

**Specter** is a dual-ESP32 RF intelligence platform built around two ESP32-WROOM-32 modules and a pair of NRF24L01+PA/LNA transceiver modules. The system provides a fully self-contained handheld interface — controlled via three push buttons and a 0.96" OLED display — capable of:

- Scanning and displaying nearby **WiFi networks** with SSID, RSSI, channel and encryption
- Scanning nearby **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** devices
- Performing a **passive 2.4 GHz spectrum sweep** across all 126 NRF24 channels simultaneously using two radios
- Broadcasting **custom alert messages** to all nearby devices via WiFi SSID and BLE beacon — no connection required
- Running **JR.IO**, a dual-radio 2.4 GHz constant-carrier disruptor in sweep or random-hop mode

The system is split across two ESP32s: **ESP1** handles all RF work (NRF24 scanning, WiFi scan, BLE scan, alerts, JR.IO) and **ESP2** handles the user interface (OLED display, buttons, menu navigation). They communicate over a direct hardware UART link.

## Features

### 🎬 NUKRAX Boot Sequence
A high-tech 4-phase glitch animation plays on boot:
- **Static burst** — random noise fills the screen
- **Text emergence** — "NUKRAX" glitches in through noise
- **Active glitch hold** — HUD corner markers, scan lines, blinking cursor, subtitle flicker
- **Dissolve out** — text breaks apart, screen wipes to black

### 📡 JR.IO — 2.4 GHz Disruptor *(Main Feature)*
- Both NRF24L01+PA/LNA modules output a **continuous unmodulated 2.4 GHz carrier** at maximum power (+20 dBm)
- **Slide switch** on ESP1 selects mode live — no restart needed:
  - `Switch HIGH` → **Sweep mode** — HSPI sweeps ±2 channels, VSPI sweeps ±4, staggered for maximum band coverage
  - `Switch LOW` → **Random hop** — both radios jump to independent random channels every ~60 µs
- Runs in a **zero-delay tight loop** for maximum disruption efficiency

### 📶 WiFi Scanner
- Scans all nearby networks including **hidden SSIDs**
- Displays SSID, channel, RSSI in dBm, encryption status, BSSID
- Results sorted by signal strength
- Scrollable list with detail view

### 🔵 BLE Scanner
- 6-second passive BLE advertisement scan
- Displays device name, MAC address, RSSI
- Identifies unnamed advertisement-only devices

### 📊 NRF24 Spectrum Analyser
- Both NRF24 radios sweep simultaneously — HSPI covers channels 0–62, VSPI covers 63–125
- Full 2.4 GHz band visualised as a **bar graph spectrum** on OLED
- WiFi channel 1, 6, 11 marked on spectrum display
- Pannable view with UP/DOWN buttons

### 🚨 Alert System — No Connection Required
Sends alert messages to ALL nearby devices automatically:

| Method | How it reaches phones | Range |
|---|---|---|
| **WiFi SSID Only** | Alert message IS the WiFi network name — visible in every phone's WiFi list | ~100m |
| **BLE Beacon Only** | Alert message IS the BLE device name — broadcasts 50 packets/sec | ~50m |
| **Blast All** | Both simultaneously at maximum TX power | ~100m |

Custom messages can be composed character by character on the device itself.

## Hardware

### Components Required

| Component | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-WROOM-32 Dev Module | 2 | Any standard ESP32 dev board |
| NRF24L01+PA/LNA Module | 2 | Must be PA/LNA version for maximum range |
| 0.96" I2C OLED Display (SSD1306) | 1 | 4-pin I2C, 128×64, connected to ESP2 |
| Push Button | 3 | UP, DOWN, MIDDLE — 6×6mm tactile |
| Slide Switch | 1 | 3-pin, connected to ESP1 GPIO33 |
| Jumper Wires | — | Male-to-male and male-to-female |
| Breadboard or PCB | — | For assembly |
| 100µF Capacitors | 2 | One per NRF24 module for power stability |

### NRF24L01+PA/LNA Module
<img src="https://github.com/CosmoLanex/Specter/blob/main/assets/nrf24l01.jpg?raw=true" width="300"/>

> ⚠️ **Important:** Use the PA/LNA version (with external antenna), not the basic onboard-antenna version. The 100µF capacitor across VCC/GND of each module is strongly recommended to prevent brown-out resets.

### ESP32-WROOM-32
The project uses two standard ESP32-WROOM-32 dev modules. Any 38-pin ESP32 dev board with the standard pinout works.

### 0.96" OLED Display
4-pin I2C SSD1306 module. Blue or white color — both work identically with the code.

```

**ESP2** is the brain for UI — it receives button input, renders every screen, and sends commands over UART.

**ESP1** is the RF worker — it executes every scan, runs JR.IO, and broadcasts alerts. Results are sent back to ESP2 for display.
